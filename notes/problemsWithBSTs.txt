 - O(n) time to insert/delete/search
	- LinkedList is faster

HOW TO COMBAT:
	balanced BSTs
	-------------
   - add constraints to regular BSTs to force a particular structure
   - the height (or depth) of these trees is logarithmic ...
	O(logn) when n elements are in the tree
	because it is balanced --> each level of depth contains roughly
	double the number of nodes as the previous level

OUR FOCUS:
	Red-Black Tree
	--------------
   - each node in the tree gains one variable: color
   - color will be red OR black (blood & bruises)
   - ROOT is BLACK
   - IF a NODE is RED then BOTH its CHILDREN are BLACK
   - for every node in the tree, all paths to every leaf 
	must have the same number of black nodes
     * a node x-to-leaf will encounter bh(x) black nodes along that path.
        - we call this the BLACK HEIGHT of the tree
     * ensures balance

	=> tree height â‰¤ 2log(n+1)
